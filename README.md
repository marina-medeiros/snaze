# Introduction

The Snaze game is a C++ implementation of the classic Snake arcade game with a twist: the snake is trapped inside a maze! This program simulates the game by loading maze levels from an input text file, provided on the configuration file, and controlling the snake's movements. The main challenge is to design a basic artificial intelligence (AI) engine that guides the snake to food pellets that pop out at random places inside the maze without running into the mazeâ€™s walls or itself.
